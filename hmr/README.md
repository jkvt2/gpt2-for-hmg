### Requirements
- Python 2.7
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) tested on version 1.3, demo alone runs with TF 1.12

### Installation

#### Linux Setup with virtualenv
```
virtualenv venv_hmr
source venv_hmr/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
deactivate
source venv_hmr/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Install TensorFlow
With GPU:
```
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.3.0
```
Without GPU:
```
pip install tensorflow==1.3.0
```

### Windows Setup with python 3 and Anaconda
This is only partialy tested.
```
conda env create -f hmr.yml
```
#### if you need to get chumpy

### Demo

1. Download the pre-trained models
```
wget https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~kanazawa/cachedir/hmr/models.tar.gz && tar -xf models.tar.gz
```

2. Run the demo
```
python -m demo --img_path data/coco1.png
python -m demo --img_path data/im1954.jpg
```

Images should be tightly cropped, where the height of the person is roughly 150px.
On images that are not tightly cropped, you can run
[openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) and supply
its output json (run it with `--write_json` option).
When json_path is specified, the demo will compute the right scale and bbox center to run HMR:
```
python -m demo --img_path data/random.jpg --json_path data/random_keypoints.json
```
(The demo only runs on the most confident bounding box, see `src/util/openpose.py:get_bbox`)

### Webcam Demo (thanks @JulesDoe!)
1. Download pre-trained models like above.
2. Run webcam Demo
2. Run the demo
```
python -m demo --img_path data/coco1.png
python -m demo --img_path data/im1954.jpg
```

### Opensource contributions
[Dawars](https://github.com/Dawars) has created a docker image for this project: https://hub.docker.com/r/dawars/hmr/

[MandyMo](https://github.com/MandyMo) has implemented a pytorch version of the repo: https://github.com/MandyMo/pytorch_HMR.git

[Dene33](https://github.com/Dene33) has made a .ipynb for Google Colab that takes video as input and returns .bvh animation!
